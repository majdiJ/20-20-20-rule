                    <h2>What is the 20-20-20 Rule?</h2>
                    <p>
                        The 20-20-20 rule (also known as 20/20/20 rule, blink break rule) is a guideline created by
                        American optometrist Dr. Jeffrey Anshel in 1991 to help reduce digital eye strain (also called
                        computer vision syndrome). The rule states for every <strong>20 minutes</strong> of screen time,
                        look at something at least <strong>20 feet</strong> away (6.096 meters), for at least <strong>20
                            seconds</strong>. By taking periodic breaks from looking at your screen and looking at
                        somthing far away, you allow your eyes to relax, reducing eye strain.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        While not commonly mentioned, Dr. Anshel also suggested that people follow the 3-B approach:
                        blink, breathe, and break:
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        <strong>Blink:</strong> People tend to blink less often when staring at digital screens, which
                        contributes to dryness and irritation. Anshel’s approach reminds people to consciously blink
                        more often.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        <strong>Breathe:</strong> Because extended screen work can cause tension, stress, and shallow
                        breathing, Anshel encouraged deeper breathing to help relieve general (non‐ocular) tension. He
                        believed breathing was important in reducing stress.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        <strong>Break:</strong> The “break” part is where the 20-20-20 prescription comes in. Every 20
                        minutes, look at something ~20 feet away for ~20 seconds to let the eye muscles relax.
                    </p>

                        The timer on this website is to help people follow the 20-20-20 rule created by Dr. Jeffrey
                        Anshel to reduce eye strain and computer vision syndrome. Start the timer and for 20 minutes,
                        spend time working. Once the timer goes off, click start again and spend the 20 seconds relaxing
                        your eyes by looking 20 feet away (6.096 meters).

                    <p>
                        Asthenopia (more commonly known as eye strain or eye fatigue) is when your eyes feel tired,
                        uncomfortable, or sore after extended use. Usually it’s not serious, but it can be bothersome
                        and affect your daily activities. It often occurs when you visually focus on tasks for a long
                        period, especially close-up work.

                        <h3>The physiology behind eye strain</h3>

                        <p>
                            When you focus on something up close, like a book, phone, or computer, tiny muscles inside
                            your eye (the ciliary muscles) contract to change the shape of your eye lens, allowing you
                            to focus clearly. At the same time, your extraocular muscles (the ones that move your eyes)
                            must keep both eyes aligned on the same point, a process called vergence.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            If you keep this focus on close up objects for long periods without breaks, those muscles
                            can become fatigued, just like your leg muscles would if you held a squat too long. This is
                            the root of asthenopia: your eyes’ focusing and alignment systems are overworked.

                            Sometimes also called digital eye strain, computer vision syndrome (CVS) is a more specific
                            condition, where eye strain is caused by prolonged digital screen use. Includes the common
                            eye strain symptoms (tired, sore eyes, blurred vision, headaches) plus factors unique to
                            screens: Reduced blinking, thus leading to dry eyes, and poor posture while using devices.
                            CVS is a type of eye strain.

                        <p>
                            Computer vision syndrome has become increasingly common as people around the world spend
                            more time on digital screens for both work and leisure. Many jobs now require extensive
                            screen use, and in their free time, people often turn to screens for gaming, streaming films
                            and media, or reading books and articles. We are surrounded by the use of screens in our
                            faces, staring our eyes - but we can mitigate this.

                        <h3>How to mitigate asthenopia (eye strain) and computer vision syndrome</h3>

                        <p>The best way to reduce eye strain and computer vision syndrome is to give your eyes rest,
                            improve your visual environment, and support good eye health.</p>

                        <ol>

                                <strong>Follow the 20-20-20 rule</strong><br>
                                Every 20 minutes, look at something 20 feet away for at least 20 seconds.<br>
                                This relaxes the eye muscles that focus up close.
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                <strong>Adjust screen setup</strong><br>
                                Keep the screen 20–28 inches (50–70 cm) from your eyes.<br>
                                The top of the screen should be at or slightly below eye level.<br>
                                Reduce glare by using a matte screen filter or adjusting lighting.
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                <strong>Optimise lighting</strong><br>
                                Avoid harsh overhead lights or strong glare from windows.<br>
                                Use soft, indirect lighting.<br>
                                Adjust brightness and contrast on screens so they’re comfortable (not too dim or too
                                bright).
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                <strong>Blink more often</strong><br>
                                Screen use lowers blink rate, therefore leading to dry, irritated eyes.<br>
                                Remind yourself to blink or try the 20-20-20 rule as a cue.<br>
                                Artificial tears (lubricating eye drops) can help if dryness persists.

                                Make sure your glasses or contact prescription is up to date.<br>
                                Consider computer glasses (anti-reflective coating, blue-light filter, or

                    <p>
                        The 20-20-20 rule created by Dr. Jeffrey Anshel in 1991 aimed to help reduce eye strain for
                        prolonged computer users who often reported having eye issues. Based on recent studies and
                        commentary Dr. Anshel’s guidance faces some criticism and limitations. While the general
                        consensus still agrees, taking periodic breaks from computer screens and focusing on further
                        distances to relax your eyes is very important to preventing eye strain. The duration of working
                        and resting periods is often criticised, along with the lack of suggestion of movement, limited
                        empirical evidence for helping reduce eye strain for everyone, question of effectiveness and
                        arbitrary numbers.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Critics argue that 20 seconds might be insufficient for many users to truly rest the eyes,
                        especially when staring continuously at screens for prolonged periods. Some suggest longer
                        breaks or breaks that involve movement, not just changing focus. Additionally, the ‘20 feet’
                        distance may not always be possible in many environments (small rooms, cramped offices) or
                        meaningful (if there's nothing interesting/distant enough to focus on).
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        The 20-20-20 rule focuses solely on eye health and not just general health while working. While
                        it is made to reduce eye strain, critics say that incorporating movement, posture and ergonomics
                        would be much more useful than just looking 20 feet away, for 20 seconds. Having your
                        workstation set-up in a correct manner would both benefit your eyes and more importantly, your
                        whole body (Read more about ergonomics & posture in <a href="#Ergonomics-and-posture">6.
                            Ergonomics & posture</a> along with useful YouTube videos).
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Another issue is with discipline to the rule, many people forget to take breaks, ignore them or
                        just glance at somthing for a couple of seconds not following the full ‘20 feet away, for 20
                        seconds’ rule. In the study “The effects of breaks on digital eye strain …,” improvements in
                        self-reported dry eye symptoms and digital eye strain were seen with the 20-20-20 reminders over
                        two weeks. But after stopping the reminders, the improvements tended to fade. This suggests that
                        consistency / habit-building is required, and that short-term adherence may not lead to lasting
                        change without ongoing effort.

                    <h2>Better alternatives and improvements to the 20-20-20 rule</h2>

                    <p>
                        The main criticism of the 20-20-20 rule is that taking regular breaks and looking far away isn’t
                        enough to improve eye strain, and that the rule focuses solely on eye health and not general
                        body strain while working. Critics say that better guidance would be to have physical movements:
                        stand, stretch, roll your shoulders, short walk etc while you take your break. Allowing you to
                        relax and stretch more muscles of your body, improves blood flow, and relieves stress.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Another improvement is setting up your workstation in the correct manner, this would both
                        benefit your eyes and more importantly, your whole body. This can reduce neck pain, shoulder
                        tension, back pain, etc (Read more about ergonomics & posture in <a
                            href="#Ergonomics-and-posture">6. Ergonomics & posture</a>)
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Some studies suggest taking longer breaks every 60-90 minutes with 5 - 10 minutes breaks can
                        help. This gives both the eyes and body more rest while still giving time to be concentrated on
                        your work. Other studies on break schedules suggest that “self-paced breaks” or more frequent,
                        individualised breaks yield better results than rigid schedules. You can change the work / rest
                        duration in the timer settings to match your schedule.

                    <p>
                        The best break/work schedule for you depends on what’s most important to you. If you want to
                        maximise physical health, try taking longer breaks with more movement, breathing and reflections
                        on your posture. If you want to maximise concentration and work, try doing longer work phases
                        and regular but small breaks. Still relaxing your eyes and moving your body.

                                            your eyes feel, how dry or tired they are, blink a few times to re-lubricate
                                            them. reflect on your posture, see if you need to adjust it. Bad posture can
                                            lead to more eye strain. Use the next minute to look at something 20 feet
                                            away, try and focus on different objects at different distances. This helps
                                            relax your eye muscles. Remember to blink often while working.

                                            Every 20 minutes working, take a 5 minute break. Use the first minute to
                                            check posture and look about 20 feet away. For the remaining time close
                                            your eyes, take slow deep breaths and focus on how your body and breath
                                            feel; if your mind wanders, gently bring attention back to the breath.
                                            When the break ends, open your eyes slowly and return to work.
